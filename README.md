# Volume-Surface_Area
This program is designed to find the volume and surface area of many different shapes. This will receive updates, but as of the time i am writing this, there are 8 different shapes. This program is coded in python. If you can make the code better do so, but if you upload your new version, make sure to credit my original work.
